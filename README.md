PigScript Avro Test
===================

This maven project accompanies my [blog post on writing tests for an Apache Pig Script that loads data from an Avro file](http://flyingtophat.co.uk/blog/2016/08/29/unit-testing-avro-pig-script.html).

The simplest way of running the project is via the `test` phase:

```
$> mvn clean test
```
